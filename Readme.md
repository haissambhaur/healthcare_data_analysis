# Healthcare Data Analysis

This project performs exploratory statistical analysis on hospital patient data to uncover insights related to patient demographics and disease distribution.

## Objectives

The following key questions are addressed:

1. What is the total number of patients?  
   → Count of unique patients in the dataset.

2. How is the patient population distributed by gender?  
   → Gender-based breakdown of patients.

3. Patient's age-group by total visits  
   → Categorizing patients into age groups and comparing total hospital visits.

4. Which diseases are most commonly diagnosed among the patients?  
   → Frequency distribution of diagnoses.

5. Are certain diseases more prevalent in one gender compared to the other?  
   → Cross-analysis of disease vs. gender distribution.
